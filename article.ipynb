    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Introduction to Acute Cerebral Infarction and the Importance of Prognosis Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "Acute Cerebral Infarction (ACI), commonly known as ischemic stroke, remains a major cause of death and long-term disability worldwide. It occurs due to the sudden obstruction of blood flow to the brain, often resulting from an embolism or thrombosis, which leads to neuronal damage and functional impairments (Feigin et al., 2014). Early and accurate prediction of prognosis in ACI patients is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies, resource allocation, and patient counseling (Lees et al., 2010). The ability to predict outcomes such as survival, functional recovery, and recurrence risk is essential for improving patient care and reducing the burden on healthcare systems (Donnan et al., 2008; Hankey, 2017; Heuschmann et al., 2011).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Inflammatory Indicators and Their Association with the Prognosis of Acute Cerebral Infarction\n",
    "\n",
    "Inflammation is a key component of the pathophysiological response to cerebral ischemia. Following an ischemic event, a complex inflammatory cascade is triggered, involving both the central nervous system and peripheral immune responses (Chamorro et al., 2012). Elevated levels of inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) have been associated with increased stroke severity and worse outcomes**根据结果更换几个炎症指标** (Whiteley et al., 2011). These markers reflect the extent of tissue damage and the body's response to injury, making them valuable predictors of prognosis (Montaner et al., 2003; Vila et al., 2000; Smith et al., 2006). Understanding the role of inflammation in ACI can inform the development of targeted therapies and enhance prognostic models (Emsley & Tyrrell, 2002; Tuttolomondo et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2016).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Introduction to Machine Learning and SHAP Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning (ML) offers advanced analytical capabilities for handling complex and high-dimensional datasets, making it a powerful tool for medical prognosis (Obermeyer & Emanuel, 2016). In stroke research, ML algorithms can integrate various clinical and biological variables to create predictive models with superior accuracy compared to traditional statistical methods (Kansagra et al., 2020).  However, although the ML approach is powerful due to the complexity of the model, it is still limited by the difficulty of stating a direct interpretation, as a so-called “black-box”. \n",

    "machine learning for geneticists. Trends Genet. 2020;36:442–455.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method provides a framework for interpreting these models by quantifying the contribution of each feature to the prediction (Lundberg & Lee, 2017). SHAP values enhance the transparency and interpretability of ML models, which is critical for their application in clinical settings where understanding the decision-making process is as important as the predictions themselves (Molnar, 2019; Ribeiro et al., 2016; Shrikumar et al., 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Aim of Our Study\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of our study is to develop and validate a predictive model for the prognosis of Acute Cerebral Infarction using inflammatory indicators, leveraging machine learning techniques. We intend to evaluate the model's performance in terms of discrimination and calibration, ensuring it accurately predicts patient outcomes. Furthermore, we aim to employ the SHAP method to interpret the importance of individual inflammatory markers, providing insights into their roles in prognosis. Our ultimate goal is to enhance the understanding of the prognostic value of inflammatory responses in ACI and to develop a robust predictive tool that can improve clinical decision-making and patient management.潞河医院京东地区的代表性，大社区，通州地区人民出生到死亡，内部有效性极高\n",

    "In summary, this research seeks to integrate inflammatory biomarkers and machine learning methodologies to advance prognostic modeling in Acute Cerebral Infarction, potentially leading to better patient outcomes and more efficient healthcare delivery.\n",

    "#### Study Population\n",
    "This real-world research was conducted at Luhe Hospital, encompassing the period from January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2023. A total of 1017 patients, aged over 18 years, who had Acute Cerebral Infarction (ACI) confirmed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain within 48 hours of symptom onset, were consecutively enrolled in the study.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Collection and Processing\n",
    "We collected demographic characteristics, labortory data(mainly inflammatory indicators) and vital sign measurements. All data were obtained from the EMR system. To ensure the robustness of the data, multi-collinearity among the variables was assessed using the variance inflation factor (VIF). Any indicator with a VIF greater than 10 was considered highly collinear and was either excluded or combined with other indicators to lighten the effects of multi-collinearity. In addition, features with over 10% missing vlaues were excluded in the following analyses to minimize the bias resulting from missing data. Finally, 20 features, including sex, age, smoking, drinking, length of stay (LOS), previous stroke, valvular heart disease (VHD), atrial fibrillation (AF), Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary heart disease (CHD), White Blood Cells (WBC), neutrophil percentage (N%), Lymphocytes percentage (L%), monocytes percentage (M%), Neutrophil count (N), Lymphocytes count (L), Monocytes count (M), Red blood cells (RBC), hemoglobin (HB), platelets (PLT), Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP), D-dimer, Platelet-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR),  Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), Systemic Inflammation Index (SII), Systemic Inflammatory Response Index (SIRI), Glucose (GLU), Emergency diastolic blood pressure SBP_EM, DBP_EM, SBP_IN, DBP_IN, indicators measured 24 hours after hospital admission: WBC_24h,  N%_24h, L%_24h, M%_24h, N_24h, L_24h, M_24h, RBC_24h, HB_24h, PLT_24h, D-dimer_24h, PLR_24h, NLR_24h, SII_24h, SIRI_24h, triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDLC), Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDLC), Monocyte to High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Ratio (MHR), cause of stroke (COS), venous thrombectomy (VT), thrombectomy, bridging, Arterial occlusion site (AS), thrombectomy times (TT), Onset to time of presentation (OTTP),National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale of inpatient (NIHSS_IN), NIHSS_24h, CTble, sICH, infectious    **根据原始数据收集及相关性及共线性选择，以炎症指标为主**  were utilized to develop the prediction models.\n",

    "#### Definition of ACI and Its Prognosis\n",
    "Acute Cerebral Infarction was defined based on clinical symptoms and confirmed by CT or MRI within 48 hours of symptom onset. Moreover, the dmRS, a simplified scoring system derived from the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), designed specifically for this study as a predictive indicator for pognosis at 90 days post-discharge. The dmRS assigns scores based on the level of disability or dependency in daily activities, ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (death). In our study, we have adapted the mRS into a binary outcome measure by categorizing scores as follows:\n",
    "dmRS < 3: Indicates a Favorable prognosis, suggesting minimal to moderate symptoms with some level of independence in daily activities.\n",
    "dmRS ≥ 3: Indicates a Unfavorable prognosis, reflecting severe disability or dependency in daily activities.\n",
    "This simplified scale was chosen for its ease of use and ability to provide a clear dichotomy between favorable and unfavorable outcomes in our patient population.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Development and Comparison\n",
    "The dataset was randomly split into a training set (70%) and a validation set (30%). Missing data (less than 10%) were handled using multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) to maintain the integrity of the dataset. Twelve machine learning (ML) models were developed, including adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), artificial neutral network (ANN), decision tree (DT), extra tree (ET), gradient boosting machine (GBM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), logistic regression (LR), Naive Bayes, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGboost). These models utilized a comprehensive set of features derived from the inflammatory indicators. The performance of each model was evaluated using commonly used evaluation indexes including the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), accuracy, and F1 score.\n",

    "#### Feature Selection and Model Explanation\n",
    "The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was employed to rank the importance of input features and to provide an interpretable explanation of the model's predictions.

    "The data collected were used to generate 12 ML models to predict the prognosis of acute cerebral infarction patients. Among the 12 models, GBM model (AUC=0.934) had the best predictive effect for prognosis, followed by LightGBM model (AUC=0.926) and Adaboost model (AUC=0.925). The discriminative performances of these 12 models are listed in Table 2, and the ROC curves and the SHAP summary plots of the top 20 features for the 12 ML models are presented in Fig.2. We reduced the features based on the feature important rank and the changes in AUCs for these 12 models showed that GBM model have the best predictive performance, as showned in Fig.2B. And the performance of GBM model with features reduction is displayed in Fig 2C. The accurancy, AUCS, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and F1 score were calculated at the best cutoff in the circumstance of best Youden index.\n",

    "The final model was identified during the feature reduction of the GBM model. As showned in Fig 2C, the 10-feature model was the appropriate both in number of features and the value of AUC in predicting prognosis of the patients. hence, we focused on the 10-feature GBM model including NIHSS, NLR_24h, LOS, L_24h, N_24h, SII_24h, as the final model for further anallysis. and the accurancy, AUCS, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and F1 score of the final model were 0.929, 0.866 for prediciting the prognosis respectively.   \n",

The application will automatically predict the risk of prognisis when the actual values of the 6 features required for the model are entered. Additionally, a force plot for the individual patient will also be displayed to indicate the features that contribute to the decision of prognosis: the blue features on the right are the features pushing the prediction towards good prognosis.
